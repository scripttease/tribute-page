        Margaret Heafield Hamilton is a computer scientist and systems engineer. She was Director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for the Apollo space program. Thanks to her pioneering work in asynchronous programming, the computer on the Apollo 11 moon landing module was able to overcome an error (caused by hardwear engineering) and successfully land on The Sea of Tranquility.
